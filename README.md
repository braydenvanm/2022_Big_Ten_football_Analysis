# Introduction
This app is designed to allow for easy comparison of Big Ten Football teams over the recent seasons. The overall goal is to allow users to identify
teams they would like to analyze, and quickly see season by season trends, find strengths and weaknesses, and compare with other Big Ten Teams
to highlight play styles and begin to vizualize the stronger and weaker teams. Additionally, this serves to highlight the stark differences
between the regular seasons and the Covid affected season.

# Data
The data was obtained from CollegeFootballData.com filtered down to only Big Ten teams. The data needed to be pivoted and appended to each other 
in order to easily create visuals. Additional resources include the color codes from Teamcolorcodes.com and an image including the logos of all 
the current Big Ten Teams. 

# Future Work
Expansion of this project could include a variety of different paths. One interesting idea would be to use the previous seasons data to attempt to predict the 
next season stat for each team. This could be achieved via regression. Another interesting idea would be creating a heuristic ranking system to attempt
to identify which team is the strongest team each season based on the stats, and not the overall record. Comparisons could be made to the ranking system and 
the final overall standings to identify teams that over or under performed.
